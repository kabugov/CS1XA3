## Part 1: CV Webpage

Designed and created an online CV using HTML/CSS.

### Source

I used an open-source, freely licensed template from Themezy.com, copyrighted to StyleShout. 
It can be found at: https://www.themezy.com/free-website-templates/151-ceevee-free-responsive-website-template


## Part 2: Web App

Designed and created a magic marker web app, using HTML/CSS and Javascript, as part of a university-class project.

### Basic Functionality

Upon loading the web page, the app is automatically run and the following is diplayed to the user: 

The user can interact with the app by pressing the mouse down anywhere on the page, causing a drop of a randomly-selected colour to be drawn on the screen where the pointer is. As the user continues to hold down the mouse and move it around the screen, a trail of randomly-selected colours is continuosly drawn on the screen, following the position of the pointer.
